	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size.
	   An algorithm with lower time complexity is more efficient because it performs fewer operation as the input grows.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> defines the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size.
		For Example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of 0(n) means that the memory usage linearly with the input.
